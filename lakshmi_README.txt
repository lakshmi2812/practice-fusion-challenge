1. Click on the link submitted checkout the app
2. Assumption made - Similar doctors are filtered by location in this app. So, when
   the user clicks on a doctor, other doctors from the same location are shown.
3. Things I want to improve: a)Write well commented code b)Write some test cases to verify the results
4. More things to try - try making the same app using pure Javascript, HTML, CSS/Bootstrap!
